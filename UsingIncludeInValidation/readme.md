# About

Its one way to iron out ideas while learning, write all code in Program.cs and if its acceptable, clean-up and refactor to proper folders and in many classes use a class project along with other refinements.

This can also work for more complex code.

## Notes

- See NuGet packages used in the project
- See GlobalUsing.cs
- IPerson could had been an abstract class.
- Consider writing test cases for the code.

# About

A simple example for using globbing via NuGet package [Meziantou.Framework.Globbing](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Meziantou.Framework.Globbing).

The main benefit of using globbing is to match file paths using wildcards. This is useful when you want to match multiple files with a single pattern.

Unlike using conventional globbing Meziantou.Framework.Globbing has an option to bypass Inaccessible folders.

> **Note**
> For a real project the delegate/event and GetSolutionFilesAsync method should be implemented in a separate class.

## Why use Window Forms

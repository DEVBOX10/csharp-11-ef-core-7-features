One of the benefits of language extensions is reusability, fits in nicely without showing details and when placed into a global class project provides consistency to all projects. Language extensions are shunned by some developers and that is okay but for those open to extension methods the provided extensions can be helpful. The two standout extensions are Truncate for decimal and double which return values with specified decimal places without rounding.

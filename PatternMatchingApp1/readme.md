# About

This project is a sample for how to take working code and refactor, in this case a `Where` [predicate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.predicate-1?view=net-8.0).

To the reader, focus on the extension method and extended property patterns matching and not on how we got there.

A more realistic example can be found in [this project](https://github.com/karenpayneoregon/closet-code/tree/master/RecursivePatterns) at GitHub done in a Windows Form project (I use Windows Forms from time to time over console projects as sometimes it is easier to get a point across).

## About

Sample for [AspectObjectDumper](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AspectObjectDumper/1.10.2?_src=template) NuGet package. This package allows to dump object properties and fields using aspect-oriented programming.

Was browsing NuGet package and seemed worthwhile checking out. Works well but not sure about using attributes for specifying ordering of properties, ordering is not really necessary unless the class/model has a lot of properties.

## Serilog

Serilog is used to log the first two dumps while the last dump goes to Visual Studio's output window.
